## Couchbase

**All Written or Edited Personally**

### Blog Posts

_The Couchbase Blog_
*   From March to October 2021, I've personally written and/or edited every blog post on the [Couchbase Blog](https://blog.couchbase.com/), in addition to formatting and scheduling, with contributions from freelancers, other employees, and community members.

### White Papers

[_Build World-Class Web Apps Using Node.js and Couchbase_](https://github.com/bwmerkl/Clermont-Group/blob/main/Writing_Samples/Couchbase_Nodejs_white_paper.pdf)
*   I wrote this white paper using a combination of existing materials and sessions working with an in-house JavaScript expert. 
*   I wrote the first draft myself for their review/approval with only light edits.

## Neo4j

### Blog Posts

**Written or Edited Personally**

_Graph Databases for Beginners blog series_
*   This was a 14-part series (with 3 additions planned for 2021) explaining the basics of graph database technology to a non-technical audience. I wrote the original core articles in the series and some later additions, and I supervised and edited other additions to the series over the years. (All articles are bylined to the original author.)
*   Here is the first article in the series, [Graph Databases for Beginners: Why Graph Technology Is the Future](https://neo4j.com/blog/why-graph-databases-are-the-future/), with links to the other parts at the bottom of the article. 
*   The article on [ACID vs. BASE consistency models](https://neo4j.com/blog/acid-vs-base-consistency-models-explained/) consistently ranked #1-2 on Google, after any article on acid vs. base for chemistry. (Google “acid vs base” right now and see for yourself.)

_CEO Blog_
*   From 2015 to 2020, I personally ghost wrote and edited any articles that appeared on the separate blog for Neo4j’s CEO and Co-Founder, Emil Eifrem.
*   Find all of the articles here: [https://neo4j.com/emil/](https://neo4j.com/emil/)
*   My two best articles:
    *   [Helping the World To Make Sense of (News) Data](https://neo4j.com/emil/help-world-make-sense-news-data/) 
    *   [The AltaVista Effect](https://neo4j.com/emil/the-altavista-effect/)
*   Since these articles are ghostwritten, Emil said anyone could contact him directly at [emil.eifrem@neo4j.com](mailto:emil.eifrem@neo4j.com) to verify my role in these articles and that he would provide a recommendation.

_Neo4j Blog_
*   From 2015 to 2018, I personally wrote and/or edited every blog post on the [Neo4j Blog](https://neo4j.com/blog/), in addition to any formatting and scheduling, with contributions coming from freelancers, interns, other employees, and community members.
*   Here is an incomplete listing of blog posts bylined to me on [my Neo4j Blog Contributor profile](https://neo4j.com/blog/contributor/bryce-merkl-sasaki/). The listing only shows the most recent articles.

**Under My Leadership or Supervision**

_Neo4j Blog_
*   In 2018, I hired a Managing Editor to take over the day-to-day editing and publishing of the [Neo4j Blog](https://neo4j.com/blog/).
*   Over the years, this team grew as we added interns, multiple freelancers, community contributors, employees from other teams, a content agency, and eventually another full-time junior editor who I trained and onboarded.

_Neo4j Developer Blog_
*   In late 2020, I worked with the Developer Relations team to establish a [Neo4j Developer Blog](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/) on neo4j.com. (The developer blog was previously published irregularly on Medium.)
*   I coordinated across the Web, Design, Developer Relations, and Content teams to make the project happen. My blog team took over the editorial process of the Neo4j Developer Blog in February 2021.

### Ebooks and White Papers

**Written or Edited Personally**

[_The Definitive Guide to Graph Databases for the RDBMS Developer_](https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/rdbms-developers-graph-databases-ebook/)

*   For this ebook, I worked with the Developer Relations team to pull together all their resources on the topic (RDBMS to Graph), and then I wrote the first draft myself for their review/approval with only light edits.
*   Contact Michael Hunger at Neo4j at [michael.hunger@neo4j.com](mailto:michael.hunger@neo4j.com) if you need to verify I wrote this ebook.
*   [PDF link here](https://github.com/bwmerkl/Clermont-Group/blob/main/Writing_Samples/Definitive_Guide_Graph_Databases_for_RDBMS_Developer.pdf)

[_The Top 10 Use Cases of Graph Database Technology_](https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/top-ten-use-cases-graph-database-technology/)

*   I wrote the original draft of this white paper in 2015 when it was only the “Top 5” use cases. I then supervised and edited the addition of the next five use cases that were blended into the original text. 
*   This white paper has since been translated into [four other languages](https://neo4j.com/resources/top-use-cases-graph-databases-thanks/).
*   Contact Jim Webber at Neo4j at [jim.webber@neo4j.com](mailto:jim.webber@neo4j.com) if you need to verify I wrote this white paper.
*   [PDF link here](https://github.com/bwmerkl/Clermont-Group/blob/main/Writing_Samples/Neo4j_Top_10_Use_Cases_EN_US.pdf)

[_Graph Databases for Beginners_](https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/graph-databases-beginners-ebook/)

*   This ebook repurposed the “Graph Databases for Beginners” blog series into a PDF ebook (for gated downloads). 
*   As with the blog series, I wrote the original core chapters of this ebook and then supervised and edited additions over the years (2015-2021).
*   [PDF link here](https://github.com/bwmerkl/Clermont-Group/blob/main/Writing_Samples/Graph_Databases_for_Beginners_EN_US.pdf)

**Under My Leadership or Supervision**

_Other Neo4j Ebooks and White Papers_

*   Any ebook, white paper, data sheet, infographic, or report listed on the [Neo4j Resources page](https://neo4j.com/resources/) through January 2021 was personally edited or reviewed by me before publication. Most content assets were written by freelancers, other employees, or outside agencies, but given their long-term value I reviewed each one personally.

### Web Copy

**Written or Edited Personally**

I wrote or significantly edited all of the following web pages on neo4j.com:

*   [Use Cases: Fraud Detection & Analytics](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/fraud-detection/)
*   [Use Cases: Recommendation Engines](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/real-time-recommendation-engine/)
*   [Neo4j Solution Partners](https://neo4j.com/partners/solution-partners/)

*   [Why Graph Databases](https://neo4j.com/why-graph-databases/)
*   [The Home Page (not including promotional banners)](https://neo4j.com/)

**Under My Leadership or Supervision**

Any other pages on neo4j.com (up to January 2021) were written by the Content team under my leadership but were not written or edited by me directly.

### Case Studies

**Under My Leadership or Supervision**

The [customer case studies](https://neo4j.com/customers/) on Neo4j.com were all written by freelancers or agencies. From 2015 to 2018, I reviewed and edited each case study directly, and after 2018, a Content team member took over the day-to-day editing of vendor-written case studies.

## Other Clients (i.e., the WayBack Machine)

If you just really needed a writing sample of mine before my time at Neo4j (pre-2015), then here’s a few.

### Square 2 Marketing

Here are two articles I wrote for the marketing agency where I used to work in Philadelphia:

*   [Forget B2B Or B2C: How Inbound Marketing Is H2H (And Why It Matters)](https://www.square2marketing.com/blog/bid/182686/Forget-B2B-Or-B2C-How-Inbound-Marketing-Is-H2H-And-Why-It-Matters)
*   [Why Buyer Personas Are Essential To An H2H Marketing Strategy](https://www.square2marketing.com/blog/why-buyer-personas-are-essential-to-an-h2h-marketing-strategy)
*   After I left the agency, my byline was redirected to the company CEO. 

### Older Freelance Clients

Here are two freelance clients who still use my work from before 2013. I wrote all of the copy on these websites:

*   [Capitol Leasing & Financing Service](https://www.capitoleasing.com/)
*   [Faith Bible Chapel South](http://fbcsouth.org/)

Looking for anything else in particular? Email me at [bwmerkl@gmail.com](mailto:bwmerkl@gmail.com) and I might be able to dig up some dusty drafts from the archives.
